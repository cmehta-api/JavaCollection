    //HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
    //HashSet contains unique elements only.
    //HashSet allows null value.
    //HashSet class is non synchronized.
    //HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
    //HashSet is the best approach for search operations.
    //The initial default capacity of HashSet is 16, and the load factor is 0.75.
